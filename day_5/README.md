    Day 5 of 100DaysOfCode with @yu_angela (twitter)
    Today's lectures are mostly about python loops with list range(), max(), min() sum() 
    You can find this course in
        - https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

    First example is for loop
        - the for loop is being exaplined. The loop is pretty simple it uses 3 fruits 
        -> The example is given in forloop_example.py file
    
    Average height of the class coding challenge
        - I am supposed to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights
        - in her example code she had not explained range() function yet but she will in some point of the time. range() is basically looping for some defenetive ranges that is defined within braces. For example is range(0, 10) it numbers in between 0 to 10 but ten is not included into count
        - and also she did not explain about "in" keyword within for loop it is as same as English language has like in. for x in range(0, 10) --> means it is x in the range of numbers from 0 to 10
        -> The solution is given in average_height.py file

    Maximum value of the list. 
        - in this challenge I wrote a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
        - she mentioned tho that I am not allowed to use min() and max() predefined functions for finding that value it should be done using only for loop.
        -> the solution for this challenge is given in max_value.py file
    
    range() function
        - she expplined range later in here
        -> The example is 
            --> for i in range(1, 10, 2) #the last one in the braces is stepsize

    Sum of even numbers
        - the next coding challenge is finding the sum of even number from 0 to 100
        -> the solution for this challenge is given in even_sum.py file
    
    FizzBuzz interview question
        - In this coding exercise I am supposed to code fizzbuzz code that is any number that is evenly dividable by 3 is FIZZ,  any number that is evenly dividable by 5 is BUZZ, any number that is evenly dividable by 3 and 5 is FIZZBUZZ,
        -> the solution for this challenge is in fizzbuzz.py file
    
    Project of the day
        - random password generating
        - there were some googling for random.shuffle() function
        -> the solution is in password.py file
