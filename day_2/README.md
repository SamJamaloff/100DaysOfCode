    Day 2 of 100DaysOfCode with @yu_angela (twitter)
    Today lecture is about dat types, mathematical operations and their conversions (MAINLY)
    You can find this course in
        - https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

    Data types
        1st -> strings
            - string subscripting using [], indexing
        2nd -> integers
        3rd -> float
        4th -> boolean
            -> examples are given in data_types.py file

    Mathematical operation
        - plus (+)  sign is used for it
        - minus (-) sign is used for it
        - multiplication (*) asterisks sign is used for it
        - division (/) slash sign is used for it
        - powering up (**) double asterisks sign is used
        -> examples are given in mathematical_operations.py

    The acronym PEMDASLR (The order of operation in mathematical operations) from Left to Right
        - Parentheses
        - Exponents
        - Multiplication / Division --> They are equally same order
        - Addition /  Subtraction --> They are equally same order
        LR --> left to right
        -> examples are given in pemdaslr.py file

    BMI coding challenge
        - BMI --> body mass index
        - is calculated as bmi = weight/(height**2)
        -> the solution is given in bmi.py file

    Rounding function
        - round(a, b)
            -> is syntax where a is the number that need to be rounded
            and be is the number after " , " in solution

    f-String
        - converts multiple data types into string and uses inside print function

        -> examples are given in rounding.py file

    Life in weeks challenge
        - In this challenge user expected to live until 90 (in years)
        - The input is the current age
        - The output is the time left to live until 90 in days, weeks, months (format)
        -> The solution is in life_in_weeks.py file

    Tip calculator (project of the day)
        - in this  project user needs to enter total bill,
        percentage for tip and how many people are splitting the bill
        -> the solution is in the tip.py file
