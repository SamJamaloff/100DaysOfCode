    Functions
        - functions are set of instructions that works togther
        - the instruction that is given in the first video is in the functions_example.py file
    
    The reeborg website
        - executing the functions within functions
        - it is a simple as calling a function that you have defined inside the scope of your funtion that you are writing
        -> the example is given in reeborg_1.py file
    
    Block of code
        - indentations are explained 
        - spaces are not supprted in python community
    
    while()
        - while somethins_is_true:
            # DO THIS

    MOST Of the coding challenges are in the reboorg interactive website (Which I liked)
